4. List Comprehensions:
List comprehensions are a concise way of creating lists in Python. They allow you to create a new list from an existing one by applying a transformation to each element in the original list. List comprehensions are written in a single line of code, making them easy to read and understand. The syntax for a list comprehension is as follows:

new_list = [expression for item in list if condition]

Here, expression is the transformation to apply to each element in the original list. item is a variable that takes on the value of each element in the original list. condition is an optional statement that filters the elements in the original list before they are transformed. The resulting new_list is a transformed version of the original list.
